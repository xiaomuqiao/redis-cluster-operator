The second patch release for `containerd` 1.2 includes important
runtime and CRI fixes.

## Runtime
* Fix rare deadlock on FIFO creation with timeout

## CRI

**ACTION REQUIRED:**
For Kubernetes support, when upgrading containerd from 1.2.0 (including rc releases)
to 1.2.1+, a node reboot is recommended to avoid a known deadlock in 1.2.0.
See [containerd/cri#1018](https://github.com/containerd/cri/issues/1018)

* Fix a bug that a container can't be stopped or inspected when its corresponding image is deleted
* Fix a bug that the cri plugin handles containerd events outside of `k8s.io` namespace"""
